# Udacity Final Project - Communicate Data Findings

Divided into two major parts, this project involves EDA of a dataset (the Prosper Loans dataset) to investigate the structure, relationships, patterns and issues with the data. 
The second part is an explanatory analysis of findings, communicated through a slide-deck generated from a Jupyter Notebook.

The emphasis of this project is the importance of data visualisation and it's role in locating patterns and relationships, and communicating insights.

## Dataset
Prosper Loans 

## Initial Observations
- A lot of missing data, however upon consideration the missing data will not cause any issues for the analysis and for the most part do not need to be dealt with
- The majority of the loans have a status of Completed or Current, both of which are considered favourable 
- The distribution of Credit Grade and Prosper Rating are similar in shape. As both appear to be summary indicators of risk, this is expected
- Prosper loans to Californians primarily
- Prosper Loans loan money to a wide demographic, but could do more towards capturing more specific values in the Employment status and Occupation variables, which would allow for more meaningful analysis
- After dividing the loans into buckets, it is easy to see that per dollar loaned, the smallest loans carried the most risk
## Key Findings
- Prosper Loans deal primarily with smaller loans, with the majority falling below $10k

- Both low credit score and past delinquencies were good indicators of the risk of an unfavorable outcome of a loan
- Loans with higher amounts tended towards more favorable outcomes, potentially as a function of them only being available to those with higher credit scores

A big thanks to Stack Overflow, as usual, for the tips.
