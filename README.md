# Udacity Final Project - Communicate Data Findings

Divided into two major parts, this project involves EDA of a dataset (the Prosper Loans dataset) to investigate the structure, relationships, patterns and issues with the data. 
The second part is an explanatory analysis of findings, communicated through a slide-deck generated from a Jupyter Notebook.

The emphasis of this project is the importance of data visualisation and it's role in locating patterns and relationships, and communicating insights.
